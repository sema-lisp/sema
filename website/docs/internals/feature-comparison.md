# Feature Comparison

How does Sema stack up against other Lisps and Lisp-adjacent languages as a practical tool? This isn't about benchmarks (see [Lisp Dialect Benchmark](./lisp-comparison.md) for that) — it's about what you can actually _do_ out of the box.

## Languages Compared

| **Sema** | Rust (bytecode VM) | LLM-native scripting, AI tooling |

| **Racket** | Chez Scheme backend | Teaching, DSLs, research |
| **Clojure** | JVM | Production backend systems |
| **Fennel** | Lua transpiler | Game dev, Lua ecosystem |
| **Guile** | C (bytecode VM) | GNU extension language |
| **Common Lisp (SBCL)** | Native compiler | Production systems, HPC |

## Summary

Sema is not trying to be the fastest Lisp or the most theoretically pure. Its niche is **practical scripting with LLM primitives built into the language** — no other Lisp has `deftool`, `defagent`, `llm/extract`, or multi-provider conversations as first-class constructs.

If you need the **fastest execution**, use SBCL or Chez Scheme. If you need the **JVM ecosystem**, use Clojure. If you need **academic rigor and DSL tooling**, use Racket. If you need a **tiny embeddable C scripting engine**, use Janet.

If you want to **build AI agents, extract structured data from LLMs, or prototype LLM-powered tools** in a language that treats prompts as data — Sema is the only Lisp built for that.

import { onMounted } from 'vue'

onMounted(() => {
  document.querySelectorAll('table tr').forEach(row => {
    const cells = row.querySelectorAll('td, th')
    if (cells.length > 0) {
      const first = cells[0]
      if (first && first.textContent.trim().startsWith('Sema')) {
        row.classList.add('sema-row')
      }
    }
  })
